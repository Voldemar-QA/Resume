**Hi there!**

I'm a QA intern practicing manual testing, confident in creation of check-lists, test-cases, bug-reports and other artifacts.

Not only black-box testing of an interface but also API, SQL-DB and some load testing as well I'm familiar with. Currently I learn automation. My instruments: Charles, Checkvist, Confluence, DBeaver, Fiddler, Jira, Jmetr, Miro, Mockoon, Qase, Pairwise, Pict, PostgreSQL, Postman, Powershell, Sitechco, SoapUI, Visual Studio Code and more.

Before autumn 2022 I worked for 2 years in CNC machining, mastered programming in G-code and procurement of different sofisticated metal-cutting tools.

Before the pandemic for 20 years I had been a tour-leader, climbing guide and sales manager in an adventure travel company operating worldwide. There I gained and polished valuable experience and soft skills necessary to lead clients to the summit and then return them home safe and happy. At the same time I became profi in numerous booking systems, advertisement and communication with providers of services.
 
All this time I was busy in professional photo and video, shooting and editing (in Photoshop, Premiere, Sony Vegas, ACD Systems, RAW-converters etc). Some of my works are in museums and galleries.

Here are some significant artifacts from my projects as a student of QA.

Employees with 10+ years of experience get a 10% discount, and those with 20 years of experience earn a 15% discount.
