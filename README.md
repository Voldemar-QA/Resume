### **Hi there!** üñê ###

I'm a **QA intern** practicing manual testing, confident in creation of check-lists, test-cases, bug-reports and other artifacts.

Not only **black-box testing** of an interface but also **API**, **SQL-DB** and some **load testing** as well I'm familiar with. Currently I **learn automation**. My instruments: Charles, Checkvist, Confluence, DBeaver, Fiddler, Jira, Jmetr, Miro, Mockoon, Qase, Pairwise, Pict, PostgreSQL, Postman, Powershell, Sitechco, SoapUI, Visual Studio Code and more. üîç

Before autumn 2022 I worked for 2 years in **CNC machining**, mastered **programming in G-code** and procurement of different sofisticated metal-cutting tools. üòé

Before the pandemic for 20 years I had been a tour-leader, climbing guide and sales manager in an adventure **travel company** operating **worldwide**. üåè There I gained and polished valuable experience and **soft skills** necessary to lead clients to the summit and then return them home safe and happy. At the same time I became profi in numerous **booking systems**, **advertisement** and **communication** with providers of services. 

![Climb to Mt Elbrus](https://github.com/Voldemar-QA/Images/blob/main/Elbrus-climb.jpg "Climb to Mt Elbrus, 5642 m. Classic route from the South.")

All this time I was busy in **professional photo and video**, shooting and editing (in Photoshop, Premiere, Sony Vegas, ACD Systems, RAW-converters etc). Some of my works are in museums and galleries. üéû

Here are some **significant artifacts** from my projects as a student of QA. üë®‚Äçüéì

1. [***Mind-map***](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPvR5kGQ=/?share_link_id=969137486748/ "Web-site decomposition") for online ticket booking application [ticket.railway.ge](https://ticket.railway.ge/ "Georgian railways").

5. [***Decision table***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bk-55F_so79uQc4V0JIhAN6HgyNEZq4RyPuIwHgHehY/edit?usp=sharing "Combinatorics technique") for an insurance program. Conditions: The life insurance program is provided to all employees. For those who have worked in a company for more than five years, the program costs 150 USD. If an employee has worked for less than five years, it costs 250 USD. Smokers must pay an additional 25% each year. Employees with 10+ years of experience get a 10% discount, and those with 20 years of experience earn a 15% discount. Insurance can have additional packages:‚ÄØcancer protection - plus 100 USD; family pack - plus 150 USD. If a person buys car insurance for 50 USD, they get an additional 10%‚ÄØdiscount. Employees who ordered the insurance previously but missed payments cannot be reinsured.

6. Choosing [***right test techniques***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8JB1dRW4cqxKqrtW8DPRFC4dxXsOyIF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105415505288474678882&rtpof=true&sd=true "EPAM learning platform") for different cases with explanation and my own sample cases for different test techniques.

7.
